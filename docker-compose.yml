# This compose file will build the CakePHP app running on PHP7.2 and also attach
# a seperate MySQL 5.7 container and Adminer. The Adminer container will connect
# to the MySQL instance.
#
# TODO: If this method is used, the CakePHP Dockerfile will need to not build
# MySQL (as it's provided in here) and rather create the Databases and Users in
# the new MySQL container. I don't know how to do this yet but makes sense if
# using a compose file.
